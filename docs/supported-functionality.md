# Supported Functionality

The following tables list the functionality of the GitHub Actions libraries and
whether or not they are currently supported by `local-action`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> [Workflow commands](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions)
> are currently unsupported. Since `local-action` only supports
> JavaScript/TypeScript actions, it is assumed that they are using the
> [GitHub Actions Toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit).

## [`@actions/artifact`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/main/packages/artifact/README.md)

The stubbed version of `@actions/artifact` functions similarly to the real
package. However, any artifacts that are created as part of a `local-action` run
will be stored on your local workstation. The specific path must be set using
the `LOCAL_ACTION_ARTIFACT_PATH` environment variable in the `.env` file passed
to the `local-action` command.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If this variable is not set, and you attempt to interact with
> `@actions/artifact`, you will receive an error message.

| Feature              | Supported          | Notes                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `deleteArtifact()`   | :white_check_mark: |                                |
| `downloadArtifact()` | :white_check_mark: |                                |
| `getArtifact()`      | :white_check_mark: |                                |
| `listArtifacts()`    | :white_check_mark: |                                |
| `uploadArtifact()`   | :white_check_mark: | Retention settings are ignored |

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When working with artifacts that were created as part of actual GitHub Actions
> workflow runs (e.g. if you try to download an artifact from a different
> repository), these requests **will be passed to the GitHub API**.

## [`@actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/cache)

The stubbed version of `@actions/cache` functions similarly to the real package.
However, any caches that are created as part of a `local-action` run will be
stored on your local workstation. The specific path must be set using the
`LOCAL_ACTION_CACHE_PATH` environment variable in the `.env` file passed to the
`local-action` command.

- Since this is a local cache, the GitHub Actions cache limits (e.g. size,
  retention) do not apply. However, the stubbed version does enforce that the
  `key` and `restoreKeys` parameters are unique per call to `saveCache()`.
- The current implementation of the `@actions/cache` package checks whether to
  use `v1` or `v2` of the caching service. This is ignored in the local
  implementation.
- Additionally, since no actual caches are downloaded/uploaded, concepts like
  chunking, concurrency, and timeouts no longer apply. Because of this, most
  properties in the `options` parameter of `restoreCache()` and `saveCache()`
  are ignored.
- Any upload/download progress tracking is ignored. E.g. the `DownloadProgress`
  and `UploadProgress` classes are not implemented.

| Feature            | Supported          | Notes                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `restoreCache()`   | :white_check_mark: | Only the `lookupOnly` option is respected. |
| `saveCache()`      | :white_check_mark: | All options are ignored                    |
| `DownloadProgress` | :x:                |                                            |
| `UploadProgress`   | :x:                |                                            |

## [`@actions/github`](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/github)

The stubbed version of `@actions/github` functions the same as the real package.
However, the functionality is stubbed in order to ensure that all needed
environment variables are pulled from the `.env` file passed to the
`local-action` command. Otherwise, things like `github.context.eventName` will
be `undefined`. For more information, see
[#149](https://github.com/github/local-action/issues/149).

## Under Investigation

The following packages are under investigation for how to integrate with
`local-action`. Make sure to check back later!

## No Action Needed

Currently, there shouldn't be any need to stub the functionality of the
following packages from the GitHub Actions Toolkit; they _should_ function as
expected when run using `local-action`. If you do encounter a scenario where
this doesn't work correctly, please
